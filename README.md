## Project Goals

This is my first portfolio project for [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/) and my goal with this project is to display my newly acquired HTML & CSS skills. I wanted to design an aesthecticly pleasing and responisive website site that provides the best possible sites and apps to help any new Guardian who decides to join the Destiny game player base.

## User Experience (UX)

        -   As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find content specific to my needs.
        -   As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to view the site on multiple devices.

        -   As a Returning Visitor, I want to learn more about the Destiny story and Lore.
        -   As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the best way to get in contact with the developer.

    -   #### Frequent User Goals

        -   As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any new sections added to the site.
        -   As a Frequent User, I want to sign up so that I am emailed any major updates and/or changes to the website.

-   ### Design

    -   #### Imagery
        -   The large, background hero image on the splash page is designed to be striking and catch the user's attention. I wanted a Destiny related image that had a futuristic sci-fi aesthetic.
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   I wanted the color scheme to match with the hero image so variations of green and cream where used for backgrounds in the sections. I used whitesmoke and grey for the paragraphs and variations of green for all the headings. Black was used for the navbar/footer and hover effect on the anchor/button elements to contrast well with the greens chosen for the site. For the card background I used the some linear gradient colours to add some vibrancy to the asthectic.

    -   #### Typography
        -   The Poppins font is the main font used for the paragraphs throughout the website with Sans Serif as the fallback. I used font Exo 2 for all my headings. I felt that Poppins and Exo 2 worked really well together to provide that gaming text look for the site. All fonts where taken from Google Fonts and applied via @import method to CSS file.
