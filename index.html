                <p>
                    Vanguard's mission is to provide the best possible sites and apps to
                    help any new Guardian who decides to join the Destiny game
                    player base. The Destiny franchise can be very overwhelming for a
                    kinder-Guardian (community name for a new player). There are over 30 Exotic Weapons to collect, over
                    90 different pieces of Exotic armor and hundreds of cosmetics so knowing how and where to acquire
                    them is essential. Hopefully with
                    our help and the help of the fantastic developers behind these
                    sites/apps you should have the best tools at hand for your journey.

                playing Destiny since the Alpha stages of the game and the below sites have become essential to me, I
                hope they can help you enjoy the game and all it has to offer.</p>

                    <p>
                        Braytech is a Destiny fan site that allows users to view and map checklists,
                        track and view triumphs, inspect collectibles, and so much more. A big part of Destiny is
                        "Seals",
                        Seals are groups of Destiny 2 triumphs that once fully
                        completed awards the player with a Title, that can be shown in-game under the player's name.
                        Braytech
                        allows you to easily track the triumphs you require to unlock those titles. Some triumphs
                        require
                        the collection of many items, with Braytech it makes it a breeze as you can tell at anytime
                        which
                        collectible you are missing.

                    <p>
                        Destiny Item Manager is a must for any Destiny player who needs to manage their loadouts and
                        vaults
                        on the fly. Forgot to grab your favorite hand cannon from the vault? Just click and drag it to
                        your
                        active character while flying into your activity. Equip it directly if you're in the tower or
                        hanging out in orbit! Use DIM's powerful loadout optimizer to choose the stats and mods that you
                        want and let DIM find the perfect set of items to get you there. DIM can even equip your mods
                        for
                        you when you create a loadout that specifies them! Many Youtubers create
                        character
                        builds and they use DIM to create and share their loadouts, it may be the most important site
                        for
                        any Guardian.
